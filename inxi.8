.SH DESCRIPTION
.B inxi
.R is an system info script for console and IRC. However some people use inxi in their 
forum posts as well - for the same reason. It is is a fork of locsmif's largely unmaintained yet 
very clever, infobash script. inxi is co-developed, a group project, primarily with trash80 on 
the programming side. 

But the nice people at irc.oftc.net channel #linux-smokers-club all really have to 
be considered to be co-developers because of their non-stop enthusiasm and 
willingness to provide real time testing and debugging of inxi development.

Without a wide range of diverse Linux kernel based Free Desktop systems to test 
on, we could never have gotten inxi to be as reliable and solid as it's turning out to be.

And of course, locsmif, who figured out a lot of the core methods, logic, and tricks 
used in inxi, has to be considered as a primary author as well, even if inxi has been 
officially forked from his infobash script.

.SH NOTES FOR ALL USERS FOR THE OPTIONS SECTION

Options can be combined if they do not conflict. Either group the letters 
together or separate them.

Letters with numbers can have no gap or a gap at your discretion unless using \fB -t

eg  
.I inxi -AG \fRor\fI inxi -A -G \fRor\fI inxi -c10


.SH OPTIONS 

.TP
.B -A  
Show Audio/sound card information.
.TP
.B -b  
Shows basic output, short form (previously -d). Same as: inxi -v 2
.TP
.B -c \fR[\fB0\fR-\fB32\fR] 
Available color schemes. Scheme number is required. 
  
Supported color schemes: 0-32. 

.TP	 
.B -c \fR[\fB94\fR-\fB99\fR]
Color selectors run a color selector option  prior to inxi starting which lets 
you set the config file value for the selection.

Color selectors for each type display 

(NOTE: irc and global only show safe color set):
.TP
\fB -c 94 \fR   Console, out of X
.TP
\fB -c 95 \fR  	Terminal, running in X - like xTerm
.TP
\fB -c 96 \fR   Gui IRC, running in X - like Xchat, Quassel, 
Konversation etc.
.TP
\fB -c 97 \fR	Console IRC running in X - like irssi in xTerm
.TP
\fB -c 98 \fR	Console IRC not in  X
.TP
\fB -c 99 \fR	Global - Overrides/removes all settings.

Setting specific removes global.

.SH INITIALIZATION FILE
.TP 
inxi will read the following configuration/initialization files in the following order: 
.TP
/etc/inxi.conf 
.TP
$HOME/.inxi/inxi.conf 
.TP
See wiki pages for more information on how to set these up:

.SH BUGS 
Please report bugs using the following resources: 

inxi wiki, file an issue report: 
.I http://code.google.com/p/inxi/issues/list 

post on inxi developer forums: 
.I http://techpatterns.com/forums/forum-32.html 

You can also visit 
.I irc.oftc.net channel: #smxi 
to post issues. 

You may be asked to run the inxi debugger tool which will upload a data dump of all 
system files for use in debugging inxi. These data dumps are very important since 
they provide us with all the real system data inxi uses to parse out its report.
